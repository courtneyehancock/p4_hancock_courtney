			<h2>My Story</h2>
			<p>When I was just a few months old, my original owners who had recently adopted me decided to move to a new apartment complex that didn't allow pets of a certain breed. They were asking around if people could take me before they were going to bring me to a shelter. Luckily, their next-door neighbors reached out to people they knew, asking if someone, anyone, could take me (I was pretty stinkin' adorable). Upon seeing the photo and hearing what was going to happen, the neighbor's sister convinced her boyfriend to go pick me up because she was out of town and couldn't make the trip soon enough. Within hours I was so happy with my new parents! Dad taught me how to sit and shake, and mom helped me perfect my snuggling. It was difficult for me to adjust at first, and I couldn't stop pooping in the bathtub, but after awhile our little family fell into place.</p>

			<p>I absolutely refused to sleep anywhere other than in bed with my parents, so the whole "crate" thing was a no-go for me. They tried and tried, but I was persistent in my mission to be with them at all times (even in the bathroom). I learned that they get excited every time I rest my head on their leg, so I do this often. I also learned that I have RSF (resting sad face)? Mom and dad think this is hilarious and tell everyone that has ears, even the other dogs. Mom says when I try to sniffle snoffle I sound like a piggy. This earned me another name of "pigbull." I can't decide if I like it or not.</p>

			<p>I stayed with my Grammy and PawPaw for a little bit while mom and dad made arrangements for me to come live with them officially (I had been living as an illegal alien within the apartment complex). I love Grammy and PawPaw. They let me eat so much. And they have a pool! But now, it's just me and mom and dad in our little apartment. 2 years later and I couldn't be happier!</p>
